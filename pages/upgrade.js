                    <h1>Amusement Club upgrade guide</h1>
                    <h3>Last Updated 2020/04/26</h3>
                    <p>
                        At the start of <b>June 2020</b> Amusement Club will be upgraded to new version (known as 2.0) containing multiple improvements and features. 
                        However, a lot of current functionality will be replaced and changed.
                        <br/>Note that this list might update and you will be notified via daily message.
                    </p>
                    <p>Changes will take effect once new version is released.</p>
                    <p>During the upgrade process bot will experience major downtime for more than 4 hours. You will be notified about the downtime several days in advance.</p>

                    <h2>Craft card replacement process</h2>
                    <p>Crafts are being removed in favor of new effect recipes. The inflation of card count, and the change in how cards were claimed significantly reduced the chances of a craft card being claimed. Making them more expensive than they really should be/have been.</p>
                    <p>The art will be taken from the craft cards and made into new 4* cards that will not be claimable. These 4 stars will be exclusively given to those with already made effects, or single craft cards not already forged.</p>

                    <h2>Heroes</h2>
                    <p>You will have to get a new hero. Switch is free.</p>
                    <p>Your old hero level will become your personal level.</p>
                    <p>Now you can submit your own hero of choice with <code>->hero submit [MAL link]</code> if you are <b>level 25</b>. This will put your hero submission into a review queue to be accepted. Submissions will cost <code>512 * (2 ** user.herosubmits)</code> meaning the more you submit the more they will cost.</p>
                    <p>Heroes have two slots on them, these are for passive effect cards you can get recipes for in the <b>store.</b></p>
                    <p>Instead of a 50 star requirement for getting a hero. You'll now need to be <b>level 10</b></p>

                    <h2>Effect cards</h2>
                    <p>Effects have been changed from a one time purchase, infinite use item. To a recipe based, limited use item. Passive effects now expire, and active use have a usage limit.</p>
                    <p>Passive effects are now attached to <b>Heroes</b> instead of directly in inventory.</p>
                    <p>Attach a passive card to a hero slot with <code>->hero equip [slot] [passive]</code>, upon use it will mark that slot as on cooldown for 24 hours where you cannot change what is in it.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Claiming</h2>
                    <p>Claiming has been limited to 10 cards at a time</p>
                    <p>Claim window now shows if you have just claimed a favorited card, if a card is a duplicate, and how many of that card you already own</p>
                    <p>There is no longer a daily limit of claims, you can spend as many tomatoes on claims as your heart and wallet can withstand</p>
                    <p>4 and 5 stars are not normally claimable any longer, see Guild for 4 stars, and Clout for 5 stars</p>
                    <p>There's now a paginator for claims, browse your claims in any claim command over 1 card with the arrows. No need to click the link or summon!</p>
                
                    <h2>Tagging</h2>
                    <p>Card tagging is implemented, use <code>->tag [card] #tag</code> to add a tag to a card (This is global, not personal)</p>
                    <p>Tag downvoting is also added, for when someone says Ayano is best/worst girl, use <code>->tag down [card] #tag</code> to downvote a tag. Enough downvotes on a single tag removes it</p>
                    <p>If a card already has a tag you want to add, adding the same tag "Upvotes" the tag, making it require more downvotes to remove the tag</p>
                    <p><code>->tags [card name]</code> will show you the list of tags on a card, as well as how many upvotes/downvotes a specific tag has</p>
                    <p><code>->tag info [card name] [#tag]</code> will display information about a specific tag</p>

                    <h2>Auctions</h2>
                    <p>You cannot sell in auctions without having an Auction House (<b>Guild</b>) in your guild</p>
                    <p>Auction listings no longer show current price to bid in <code>->auc</code> or if you bid below highest bid with <code>->auc bid</code> instead it will show second to last bid(nox yell at me if this is wrong)</p>
                    <p>With an upgraded Auction House(<b>Guild</b>), you can specify auction length with <code>:-X</code> where X is number of hours from 1-10. This does not accept decimals</p>
                    <p>In line with auction length, auctions for specific prices has been changed to <code>:X</code> where X denotes amount. Currently does not accept decimal amounts like main bot(0.5-4.0)</p>
                    <p>You can now cancel auctions with over 1 hour remaining and no bids with <code>->auc cancel [ID]</code></p>

                    <h2>Clout</h2>
                    <p>Clout has slightly changed, in that for collections with Legendaries, you no longer need the Legendary to clout the collection</p>
                    <p>That leads into the fact that you now need to clout a collection to get it's legendary via a <code>LegendTicket</code> more on that in <b>Inventory</b>. </p>
                    <p><code>->col info [col]</code> lists clout stars, as well as number of times you have clouted (in parenthesis)</p>

                    <h2>Liquify</h2>
                    <p>Added <code>->liq [card]</code>, allowing you to liquify a card for a new currency üç∑ vials. Vials are used in <b>Draw</b></p>
                    <p>You are only able to liquify cards in the 1-3‚òÖ range, attempts of any higher will be met with a message stating this</p>
                    <p>You get üç∑ vials in proportion to a percentage of the cost it takes to <b>Draw</b> the card you are liquidating. Vials are based off of current tomato prices, making them a volatile currency</p>
                    <p>There is no tomato cost for liquefying cards</p>
                    <p>Requires Smith Hub Level 2 (<b>Guild</b>)</p>

                    <h2>Forging</h2>
                    <p>Gone are the days of 1+1=2, 2+2=3 and 3+3=3. Now everything is equal with 1+1=1, and so on. Forging no longer gives you a card of the next rarity. Forging a 1 star and a 1 star will get you a 1 star.</p>
                    <p>Forging cards now costs tomatoes relative to card cost and rarity. You will also recieve vials for forging</p>
                    <p>You can do <code>->forge [card]</code> and the bot will pick another card within the same rarity and next in name length to forge the selected card with so be careful!</p>

                    <h2>Guild Management</h2>
                    <p>Guild tax can now be set if the guild contains a Castle(See buildings), with <code>->guild set tax [rate]</code> This will tax claims for a certain percentage and have this tax placed in the guild balance</p>
                    <p><code>->guild info</code> shows basic information about the current guild such as Guild Level, # of players, Tax %, Building Permissions, as well as the user running the command's, Rank, Progress to next rank, and guild roles(if any)</p>
                    <p>Guild mods/managers have been added, these people are the only ones allowed to lock a guild to a specific collection with <code>->guild lock [col]</code>. Locking costs 100k üçÖ Tomatoes up front, and 5000 üçÖ Tomatoes a day to keep the lock.</p>
                    <p>To add a Guild mod/manager you need to be server owner and run <code>->guild add mod/manager @user</code> please note it's either mod or manager, you do not need both</p>
                    <p><code>->guild status</code> is only possible if you have a Castle, and displays current Guild's balance, maintenance fees, and a breakdown of the fees</p>
                    <p><code>->guild donate</code> has been added, use this to donate your own tomatoes to the Guild's balance to help run buildings or to help afford a lock(eventually I will be watching you)</p>
                    <p>Building Permissions can be set per guild, this makes it so that anyone below a certain rank in the guild is unable to build/upgrade new buildings, this will be added as <code>->guild set buildrank</code></p>

                    <h2>Guild Buildings</h2>
                    <p><b>Castle:</b> To build a castle you must first already have another building in the guild, this allows you to check guild status, set tax, and reduce fees for maintenence</p>
                    <p><b>Auction House:</b> The auction house must be built to allow you to sell cards on auction, decrease auction fees, and specify auction length</p>
                    <p><b>Smithing Hub:</b> This building is required for all forging, liquify, and draw actions. Level 1 allows forging, Level 2 allows <b>Liquify</b> and <b>Draw</b>, level 3 allows the crafting of effects</p>
                    <p><b>Hero's Quarters:</b> This building lets a guild have a hero. Hero gets chosen based on amount of followers of a hero in the guild.</p>
                    <p><b>Gacha Bank:</b> This building increases daily amount, enables 4 star drops at level 2, and adds user level amount of tomatoes to guild balance when a user runs <code>->daily</code>. Note this is the building that will re-enable 4 star drops in servers</p>
                    <p><b>Tavern:</b> The tavern lets you get daily quests, and the first two levels add the quests, up to two. Level 3 unlocks quest lines(to be implemented).</p>
